# Day 32: Doubly Linked Lists & Deletion
- Implemented Doubly Linked List (DLL) with 'prev' and 'next' pointers.
- Mastered SLL Deletion (Head, Tail, and Middle).
- Logic: Reversing a DLL requires swapping the next and prev pointers for every node.
- Complexity: O(1) for deletion if the node is known; O(N) if we must search for it.
