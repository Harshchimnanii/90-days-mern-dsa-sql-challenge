# Day 02 – DSA (Arrays)

## Topics Covered
- Arrays (Introduction & properties)

## Problems Solved

1. Check if array is sorted  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Second largest element in array  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

3. Count frequency of elements  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

## Key Learnings
- Arrays use contiguous memory
- Single traversal problems are efficient
