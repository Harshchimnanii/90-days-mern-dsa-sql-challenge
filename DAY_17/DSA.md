# Day 17 – DSA (Final Confidence Polish)

## Weak Areas Revisited
- Re-solved 2 DSA questions that were weak in mock
- Focused on clarity, not speed

## Confidence Set (Light)

1. Reverse array  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Two Sum  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

3. Valid Parentheses  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

4. Binary Search (simple)  
   Time Complexity: O(log n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

## Focus
- Logic clarity
- Calm execution
- No panic
