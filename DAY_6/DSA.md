# Day 06 – DSA (Hashing + Stack)

## Topics Covered
- Hashing revision
- Stack introduction

## Problems Solved

1. Two Sum (HashMap)  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

2. Check if two strings are anagrams  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

3. Valid Parentheses  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

## Key Learnings
- HashMap enables constant-time lookup
- Stack follows LIFO principle
- Stack is useful for expression validation
