# Day 09 – DSA (Binary Search)

## Topics Covered
- Binary Search concept
- Search space reduction

## Problems Solved

1. Binary Search (Iterative)  
   Time Complexity: O(log n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Binary Search (Recursive)  
   Time Complexity: O(log n)  
   Space Complexity: O(log n)

3. First and Last Occurrence  
   Time Complexity: O(log n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

4. Search in Rotated Sorted Array  
   Time Complexity: O(log n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

## Key Learnings
- Binary Search works on sorted arrays
- Search space halves every step
- Very common placement pattern
