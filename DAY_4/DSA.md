# Day 04 – DSA (Strings)

## Topics Covered
- Strings basics
- Character traversal

## Problems Solved

1. Reverse a string  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Check palindrome string  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

3. Count vowels and consonants  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

4. Check if two strings are anagrams  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

## Key Learnings
- Strings are immutable in Java
- Two-pointer technique is useful for strings
- Character frequency helps in anagram problems
