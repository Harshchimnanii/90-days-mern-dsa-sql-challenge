# Day 07 – DSA (Linked List – Basics)

## Topics Covered
- Linked List introduction
- Node structure
- Basic operations

## Problems Solved

1. Create a linked list  
   Time Complexity: O(1)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

2. Traverse a linked list  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

3. Insert at beginning  
   Time Complexity: O(1)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

4. Insert at end  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

## Key Learnings
- Linked List uses dynamic memory
- No contiguous memory required
- Insertion is easier than arrays
