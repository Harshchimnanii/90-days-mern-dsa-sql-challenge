# Day 05 – DSA (Strings + Hashing)

## Topics Covered
- String revision
- Hashing (HashMap / frequency array)

## Problems Solved

1. Valid palindrome  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

2. First non-repeating character  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

3. Count frequency using HashMap  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

## Key Learnings
- Hashing helps optimize string problems
- Frequency count is widely used in interviews
- HashMap improves lookup time
