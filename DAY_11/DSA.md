# Day 11 – DSA (Linked List – Polish)

## Topics Covered
- Linked List basics
- Insert, traverse, delete

## Problems Solved

1. Traverse linked list  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Insert at beginning  
   Time Complexity: O(1)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

3. Insert at end  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

4. Delete node by value  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

## Key Learnings
- Linked List uses dynamic memory
- Deletion requires pointer handling
- Basics are frequently asked in interviews
