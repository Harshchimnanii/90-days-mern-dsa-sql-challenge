# Day 03 – DSA (Arrays – Operations)

## Topics Covered
- Array operations
- Searching & manipulation

## Problems Solved

1. Rotate array by 1  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Remove duplicates from sorted array  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

3. Find missing number in array  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

4. Move all zeroes to end  
   Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

## Key Learnings
- Array operations mostly work in single traversal
- In-place operations save space
- Index handling is critical in arrays
